# char-combo

char-combo is a game where you are given a word in a foreign alphabet, and the
set of characters which make up the word, in random order. For example.

မြန်မာဘာသာ

မ ြ န ် ာ ဘ သ

You try to click or type the characters in the order that they appear.

I made the game to improve my ability to recognize different characters and
diacritics in the Myanmar alphabet.

You can add other scripts, such as Devanagari ( देवनागरी ) and Bengali (বাংলা লিপি)
